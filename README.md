Run prompts against LLMs hosted by https://lambdalabs.com/

## Installation

Install this plugin in the same environment as [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/).
```bash
llm install llm-lambda-labs
```
## Usage

First, [obtain an API key](https://cloud.lambdalabs.com/api-keys) for Lambda Labs and set it like this:

```bash
llm keys set lambdalabs
# Paste key here
```

To see a list of available models, run this:

```bash
llm models
```
Run prompts like this:
```bash
llm -m lambdalabs/hermes3-405b 'short poem about a pelican with a twist'
```

The list of available models is fetched the first time the plugin is run. You can refresh that cached list by running:

```bash
llm lambdalabs refresh
```

## Development

To set up this plugin locally, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
```bash
cd llm-lambda-labs
python -m venv venv

```
Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:
